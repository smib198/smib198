<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm <a href="#" target="blank">
Brad</a>👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">A programmer and tinkerer from the UK 🇬🇧</h3>

## A bit about me
- 👨‍🏫 I'm fully self taught and never went to college. I prefer to just learn by doing...Try, fail, repeat until success.

- 🖥️ I work in ICT in the public sector.

- 🤖 My passion is utilising and deploying RPA (Robotic Process Automation).

- 🤯 I am diagnosed with ADHD, which I use to my advantage when programming. The code is messy, but it works.

- 🤦‍♂️ It took me an enbarrasing amount of time to start using GitHub.

- 🤫 I have built multiple apps and websites which i'm unable to add to GitHub due to operational security.
